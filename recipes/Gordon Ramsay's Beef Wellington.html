    <h1><STRONG>INSTRUCTIONS:</STRONG></h1>

    <h3><strong>For the Duxelles:</strong></h3>

       <ol>
            <li>Add the mushrooms, onion, garlic, and thyme leaves to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped.</li>
            <li>Add the oil to a large skillet and set over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Pour the food processor mixture into the pan and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid has cooked out.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool.</li>
       </ol>

    <h3><strong>For the Beef:</strong></h3>

       <ol>
            <li>Place a heavy bottomed skillet over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Using kitchen twine, tie the tenderloin in 4 places. This will help it hold its shape while cooking.</li>
            <li>Season the beef all over with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>When the skillet is hot, add the oil and sear the beef all over to brown the meat.</li>
            <li>Do not sear the beef for more than 5 minutes total, so just a minute on each side.</li>
            <li>Remove the beef to a plate, take the pan off the heat, and set aside for later <strong>(Do not clean it)</strong>.</li>
            <li>Lay out a large piece of plastic wrap, about 18 inches or so, and evenly space out the prosciutto so that it covers most of the plastic wrap. You want it spread out enough to fully wrap the beef when we roll it up.</li>
            <li>Spread the duxelles evenly over the prosciutto, then sprinkle with salt, pepper, and a few extra thyme leaves.</li>
            <li>Trim the twine from the beef, brush the tenderloin with the Dijon mustard, then place the beef on the duxelles. Use the plastic wrap to wrap the entire beef tenderloin in the duxelles and prosciutto, then twist the ends of the plastic wrap tightly so the beef holds its log shape. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
            <li>On a floured surface, roll the puff pastry thinly enough so it can wrap around all of the beef, about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Remove the beef from the plastic wrap, then set the beef in the center of the puff pastry, and roll it tightly in the puff pastry.</li>
            <li>Crimp the edges, using egg wash to help you seal the edges and sides. Place the beef seam side down onto a sheet pan. Brush the entire pastry with the egg wash, then cut Xs on top to let the steam escape while cooking.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25 to 35 minutes* until the beef measures 125F with a thermometer, and the puff pastry is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and place the beef on a wire rack to rest for at least 10 minutes while you make the sauce.</li>
       </ol>

    <h3><strong>For the Beef Wellington Sauce:</strong></h3>

       <ol>
            <li>Add butter to the pan you seared the beef in, and set over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the onion, garlic, and thyme, and saute for 5 minutes to impart the flavors.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat, add the brandy, then if youâ€™re using a gas stove, light the brandy to burn the alcohol off. If you have an electric stove, you can skip that step</li>
            <li>After the flame has died down, return the pan to the heat and add the beef stock. Turn the heat to high and reduce the liquid by half.</li>
            <li>Add the cream and mustard, then strain the sauce to remove the solids.</li>
            <li>Slice the beef wellington into thick slices, about 2 inches wide, and serve with the sauce. <a href="./Beef Wellington Images/Enjoy.gif"><STRONG><EM>ENJOY!</EM></STRONG></a></li>
