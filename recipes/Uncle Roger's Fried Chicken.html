    <h1>Finger Fuckin' Lickin Good Fried Chicken</h1>

    <p>From the east side to the west, we know this shit be bangin'. Flavored or original recipe, once it hits the dining table, we know it unites the soul with the mind the same it unites all races.</p>
    <p>Let me give you a short poem about Fried Chicken being a soul food:</p>
        <h4><strong>Cluckin' In</strong></h4>
        <p>Fried chicken's the king, no debate,</p>
        <p>It’s crispy, it’s juicy, it’s on my plate!</p>
        <p>I’ll take it with gravy, or maybe hot sauce,</p>
        <p>It’s the food that makes me forget my boss.</p>

        <p>With a side of mac 'n' cheese and cornbread,</p>
        <p>I’m livin’ my best life, no need to be fed!</p>
        <p>If you think it’s not soul food, well that’s a crime—</p>
        <p>Fried chicken’s the MVP, every single time!</p>

    <h2><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h2>

            <li>⅔ tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon ground thyme</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon basil</li>
            <li>⅓ tablespoon oregano</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon celery salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dry mustard powder</li>
            <li>4 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons ground white pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Accent flavor enhancer (MSG) <em>optional</em></li>
            <li>1 whole chicken</li>
            <li>1 egg beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup full-fat buttermilk</li>
            <li>canola oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken into breast, thigh, leg, and wing pieces.</li>
            <li>In a shallow bowl, mix together the flour and all of the seasonings.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add buttermilk and beaten egg. Stir or whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces to the buttermilk mixture.</li>
            <li>Soak the chicken for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place a wire rack on top of a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>To bread the chicken, remove the chicken from the buttermilk and shake off excess.</li>
            <li>Place each piece into the flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Coat the chicken fully and then shake off all of the excess flour.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken onto the wire rack.</li>
            <li>Bread all of the chicken. The breaded chicken should rest for about 15 minutes before frying.</li>
            <li>Heat oil to 350 degrees in a deep fryer. If you do not have a deep fryer you should use a Dutch oven and fill it half full of vegetable shortening. If you are using a Dutch oven, use a thermometer to make sure the temperature is maintained at 350 degrees. If the temperature drops too low, the breading will become greasy.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken in 2 or 3 batches. The breasts and thighs will take about 15 to 18 minutes to cook. The wings and legs will take about 12 to 13 minutes to cook.</li>
            <li>Drain the fried chicken on a clean wire rack on top of a baking sheet.</li>
        </ol>
