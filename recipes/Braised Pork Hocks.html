                <li>3 cups water</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 pieces star anise</li>
                <li>3 pieces bay leaves</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon peppercorn</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                <li>¼ cup water</li>
            </ul>

    <h2><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h2>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Pour 4 cups of water into a pot. Add salt, star anise, bay leaves, and peppercorns. Bring to a simmer until salt is dissolved. Let it cool down to room temperature.</p>
                    <p>Place pork hock in a large bowl or a Ziploc bag.  Pour the brine solution over the pork hock and cover. Place in the fridge overnight (or up to 3 days).</p></li>
                <li>Remove from brine and pat the pork hock dry. In a pot just large enough to fit the whole pork hock, heat oil over medium-high heat. Sear all sides until golden about 3 minutes each side.</li>
                <li>Pour 3 cups of water and add the garlic, brown sugar, soy sauce, star anise, bay leaves, and peppercorns. Cover the pot with the lid and bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Once it starts to boil, turn down the heat to low and cook for at least 3 hours or until the skin and meat are so tender they easily separate from the bone. Remember to turn the meat every other 30 minutes. You may have to add more water until the meat reached the desired tenderness.</li>
                <li>Make sure also that by that time, you still have at least 1 cup (up to 1.5 cups) of the liquids remaining. Gently remove the pork hock and transfer to a serving dish. Run the remaining liquids through a strainer or a sieve to remove the chunky pieces. Return the liquids to the pot and turn heat to low. </li>
                <li>Dissolve the cornstarch in ¼ cup of water and gradually pour this mixture into the pot with liquids while continuously stirring to form a thick sauce.</li>
                <li>Pour sauce over the pork leg and serve. This is usually eaten with steamed rice. You may also add some steamed bok choi for sides.</li>
